[IMPORTANT]
.Feeding the Werewolves
====
While werewolves are hardy community members, keep in mind the following dietary concerns:

. They are allergic to cinnamon.
. More than two glasses of orange juice in 24 hours makes them howl in harmony with alarms and sirens.
. Celery makes them sad.

NOTE: Inline admonition

== Test equations

Reference to equation <<eq-1>>.

[latexmath]
++++
C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon

[[eq-1]]
[latexmath]
.({counter: eq})

\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}\binom{n}{k}

And here is an inline equation stem:[sqrt(4) = 2].

== Test discrete

=== Discrete heading

Some text

[discrete]
===== One more discrete heading

Some more text

== Test footnotes

The example of footnotefootnote:f1[A referenced footnote] and its referencefootnote:f1[]. Just a simple footnotefootnote:[Just a footnote].

== Test images 1

.Base64 image example
image::{base64-image-example}[width=10%]

image:asciidoc_icon.png[width=20px] Asciidoc inline icon, defined in pixels (20px), here is a long text to make this icon fall at least to the second line: image:asciidoc_icon.png[width=20px]. And some text after to have at least third line after this icon, just to see how does it influence line spacing.

The example of Asciidoc inline Base64 icon without width dimensions, it is 5px. Assuming 100 dpi resolution it should have smaller height than its line: image:{base64-image-example}[]. And some text after to have at least third line after this icon, just to see how does it influence line spacing.

This label height should be exactly 5mm in height: image:ehjnem.png[fitrect="170x5mm"]

.SVG example
image::svg_example.svg[srcdpi=300, fitrect="170x250mm"]

.SVG example 60x20

.Spring slush

== Vertical image test

Both images should look the same way in browser (10%), but differently in odt.

.Ruler, made to fit page vertically (if condidered 500dpi)
